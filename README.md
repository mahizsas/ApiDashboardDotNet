ApiDashboardDotNet
==================

This is a relatively simple app I created when playing around with .NET websockets, SignalR, NVD3 and linq.js. It's a real-time API dashboard that receives messages from RabbitMQ and then pushes them out to connected browsers. Browsers then update in real-time to display the data in a useful format.
